      <p>
      Welcome to the Wedding Event Management App, a comprehensive platform designed to simplify the wedding planning process for couples. 
      Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), this application offers a user-friendly interface and 
      powerful features to help you organize every detail of your special day.
      We aim to alleviate the stress of wedding planning by providing a centralized space for couples to manage budgets, track guest lists, connect with vendors, and create timelines. 
      Our goal is to ensure that every couple can enjoy a seamless planning experience and focus on what truly matters: celebrating their love.
